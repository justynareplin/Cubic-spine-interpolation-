# Cubic-Spline-Interpolation

The method of least squares provides, among other things, an alternative to ordinary interpolation that avoids the problem of overfitting. Another alternative is spline interpolation, which encompasses a range of interpolation techniques that reduce the effects of overfitting. The method of cubic spline interpolation presented here is widely used in finance. It applies only in one dimension, but is useful for modeling yield curves, forward curves, and other term structures.
